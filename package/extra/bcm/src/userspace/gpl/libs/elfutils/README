The elfutils-0.187.tar.bz2 is the unmodified tarball from https://sourceware.org/elfutils/.

The license is:
The libraries and backends are dual GPLv2+/LGPLv3+. The utilities are GPLv3+.

We only build and install the libraries.  We do not build the GPLv3 utilities.
(DO NOT BUILD the utilities!  We do not want to be entanged by GPLv3).

The only apps that use libelf are public/apps/minicoredumper and gpl/apps/iproute2,
so using GPLv2 libs should be ok.
