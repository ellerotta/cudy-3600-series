/* Definitions for D11AC capable Chanspec type */

/* Chanspec ASCII representation with 802.11ac capability:
 * [<band>'g']<channel>['/'<bandwidth>[<primary-sideband>]['/'<1st80channel>'-'<2nd80channel>]]
 * In above syntax, [] means optional. <> means required, if its outer element is present.
 * '' quotes a real character to be matched. Other names not being quoted are defined as below:
 *
 * band:
 *      in regex, it is defined as:
 *      [2345]
 *      2, 3, 4, 5 for 2.4GHz, 3GHz, 4GHz, and 5GHz respectively.
 * channel:
 *      channel number of the 5MHz, 10MHz, 20MHz bandwidth channel,
 *      or primary channel number of the 40MHz, 80MHz, 160MHz, or 80+80MHz bandwidth channel.
 *      For example, for 2.4GHz band, channel can be any value from 1 to 11.
 * bandwidth:
 *      in regex, it is defined as:
 *      (5|10|20|40|80|160|80\+80)
 *      If this field is not present, the default value is 20.
 * primary-sideband:
 *      in regex, it is defined as:
 *      (U|L|u|l)
 *      U or u stands for upper sideband primary, L or l stands for lower sideband primary.
 *      This field is only valid for 2.4GHz band with 40MHz channel bandwidth.
 *      For 2.4GHz band with 40MHz channel, the same primary channel may be the
 *      upper sideband for one 40MHz channel, and the lower sideband for an
 *      overlapping 40MHz channel.  The U/L disambiguates which 40MHz channel
 *      is being specified.
 *      For 40MHz in the 5GHz band and all channel bandwidths greater than
 *      40MHz, the U/L specificaion is not allowed since the channels are
 *      non-overlapping and the primary sub-band is derived from its
 *      position in the wide bandwidth channel.
 * 1st80Channel:
 * 2nd80Channel:
 *      Required for 80+80, otherwise not allowed.
 *      Specifies the center channel of the first and second 80MHz band for 80+80 Bandwidth case.
 *
 * Parsing Rules:
 *     1. We parse chanspec string from LEFT to RIGHT.
 *     2. Once the format can't be analysed correctly, the parsing would fail.
 *     3. If band is not present in chanspec string, we must have channel reading. In this case,
 *        we set band to be 2 if channel <= 14, otherwise we set band to be 5.
 *
 * Examples:
 * In its simplest form, it is a 20MHz channel number: "20", with the implied band
 * to be 5GHz, because the channel number is greater than 14.
 *
 * To allow for backward compatibility with scripts, the old form for
 * 40MHz channels is also allowed: <channel><primary-sideband>
 *
 * 5GHz band Examples:
 *      Chanspec        BW        Center Ch  Channel Range  Primary Ch
 *      5g8             20MHz     8          -              -
 *      52              20MHz     52         -              -
