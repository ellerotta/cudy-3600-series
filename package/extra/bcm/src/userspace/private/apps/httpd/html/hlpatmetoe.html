    <P>If the test fails, follow the troubleshooting procedures listed below and 
      rerun the diagnostics tests by clicking on the <b>Rerun Diagnostic Tests</b>

    <p>NOTE: This test will fail if <i>Test ADSL Synchronization </i>also fails. 
      Troubleshoot the <i>Test ADSL Synchronization</i> test first. </p>

      <li> 
        <p>Turn off the Broadband modem, wait 10 seconds and turn it back on. </p>

      <li>
        <p>With the modem on, press the external reset button on the Broadband modem 
          for at least five seconds and release it. This resets the Broadband modem 
          to its default settings. Wait for the Broadband modem to completely restart, 
          then close and restart your Web browser. To reconfigure the modem, type 
          your modem Account username and password.</p>

        <p>If this is the first time you are setting up your Broadband modem, you may
