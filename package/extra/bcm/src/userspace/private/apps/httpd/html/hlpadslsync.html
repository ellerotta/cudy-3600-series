    <P>If the test fails, follow the troubleshooting procedures listed below and 
      rerun the diagnostics tests by clicking on the <b>Rerun Diagnostic Tests</b> 
      button at the bottom of this page. If all the tests pass, close and restart 
      your Web browser to access the Internet.</P>
    <P><B>Troubleshooting:</B></P>
    <ol>
      <li> 
        <p>Make sure your phone line is plugged into the modem. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After turning on your Broadband modem, wait for at least one minute to establish 
          a connection. Run the diagnostic tests again by clicking on the <b>Rerun 
          Diagnostic Tests</b> button at the bottom of this page. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>Make sure there is no DSL micro filter on the phone cord connecting 
          the Broadband modem to the wall jack.</p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>Make sure you are using the phone cord that was supplied with your 
          Broadband modem or another similar phone cord with four copper wires visible 
          in the plug. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>If your DSL has been functioning properly for a long period of time 
          and you suddenly are experiencing this problem, there may be a problem 
          with the DSL network. You may need to wait from 30 minutes to a couple 
          of hours, and if you still do not have a solid DSL LED on your modem, 
          call Technical Support. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>Turn off the power to the Broadband modem, wait 10 seconds and turn it back 
          on. Wait at least one minute and if the DSL LED on the modem remains 
          a solid color, close your Web browser and restart it. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
