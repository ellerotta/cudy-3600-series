    <P><B>Troubleshooting:</B></P>
    <P>NOTE: If <i>Test Ethernet connection to ATM</i> fails, this test result 
      displays N/A. 
    <ol>
      <li> 
        <p>After turning on your Broadband modem, wait for at least one minute to establish 
          a connection. Run the diagnostic tests again by clicking on the <b>Rerun 
          Diagnostic Tests</b> button at the bottom of this page. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>Turn off the power to the Broadband modem, wait 10 seconds and turn it back 
          on. Wait at least one minute for the modem to establish a connection. 
          If the PPP LED on the modem turns solid green, close your Web browser 
          and restart it. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>With the modem on, press the external reset button on the Broadband modem 
          for at least five seconds and release it. This resets the Broadband modem 
          to its default settings. Wait for the Broadband modem to completely restart, 
          then close and restart your Web browser. To reconfigure the modem, type 
          your modem Account username and password.</p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>If this is the first time you are setting up your Broadband modem, you may 
          need to reconfigure your VPI/VCI settings. Contact ISP Technical Support 
          for assistance.</p>
